# HResP
HresP code is a program designed to calculate the heave response of a vessel in random/irregular waves. I hope you find it useful.

# Code Validation

The RAO (Response Amplitude Operator) values found in the file Heave.csv are sourced from Maxsurf Motion. Using this program, the spectral moments ùëö0, ùëö2, and ùëö4, as well as the RMS values for heave motion, velocity, and acceleration, are produced as output.
The RAO curve was obtained under the following conditions:

Series 60 Hull Form

- v = 4.358 m/s
- L = 30.977 m
- Hs = 1 m
- Tp = 3.5 s
- Wave Spectrum : JONSWAP with Gamma = 3.3
- Wave Heading = 180 deg (head sea)

**Below are the output results from Maxsurf Motion:**

**A comparison between the results obtained from this program and those from Maxsurf Motion is as follows:**

From the comparison, it can be observed that‚Äîgiven the same RAO curve and JONSWAP spectrum‚Äîthe RMS results generated by this program show only a small error when compared to the values from Maxsurf Motion.
If you have an RAO curve derived from CFD simulation or a 3D Panel Method, you can also use this program to estimate the heave response in random/irregular seas.

# User Guide
This code is intended to calculate the vessel's heave response in random/irregular waves, using an RAO curve as input.
The RAO data should be provided in a CSV file with space delimiters, where: The first column represents the wave length-to-ship length ratio and 
the second column contains the heave RAO values. Ensure that the RAO file is placed in the same folder as the program.
1. Run the code
2. Enter the input one by one
3. Write the RAO csv file and be sure to also include the full path to the file's location.
4. Enjoy the results
